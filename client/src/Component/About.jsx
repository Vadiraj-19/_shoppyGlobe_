        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
          Hi! I'm Vadiraj Narayan Betageri, an aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for technology and coding.
          Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication at Jain College of Engineering.
          I have gained practical experience through various internships and projects, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in the tech field.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">My Journey</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
          My journey into the world of technology began with a Diploma in Electronics & Communication, where I secured 86% and stood third in my class. During this time, I developed a strong interest in coding and technology, which led me to explore full-stack development.
          I have gained hands-on experience in various fields, including IoT, Arduino programming, CCNA routing, and web development.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
          Iâ€™ve been working on several tech projects, from building a Smart Refrigerator with IoT to developing an RFID-based Attendance System, and even a key management system for HAL. These projects have allowed me to dive deep into technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
